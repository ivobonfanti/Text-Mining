# Text-Mining

This work has a twofold objective, on one hand it aims to detect valuable insights
concerning the academic debate on nuclear plants safety, while on the other, it points
to build a model able to classify related unseen documents according to the topics
treated. The goals are met mainly adopting two unsupervised text mining techniques,
the hierarchical clustering algorithm and the latent Dirichlet allocation. Also, the
topics polarization is investigated through the application of the joint sentiment-topic
model, a semi-supervised technique. The methods are applied to a dataset built ad
hoc collecting journal article abstracts from the International Nuclear Information
System.
